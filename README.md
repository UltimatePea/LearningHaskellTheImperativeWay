# Learning Haskell the Imperative Way

Haskell is known as a purely functional programming language. However, thanks to the `do` syntax sugar on monads, it can be viewed from an imperative perspective. Opposed to traditional tutorials, this tutorial aims to migrate the concepts from imperative perspective to Haskellâ€™s pure functional concepts. It starts with the IO Monad and introduces functional programming concepts as time progresses. Your feedback of this tutorial is extremely important. Please submit any feedbacks through [Issues Page]( https://github.com/UltimatePea/Blog/issues) or email me at zhc159@ucsd.edu.  

## Prerequisite
