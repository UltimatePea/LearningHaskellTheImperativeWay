# Learning Haskell the Imperative Way

Haskell is known as a purely functional programming language. However, thanks to the `do` syntax sugar on monads, it can be viewed from an imperative perspective. Opposed to traditional tutorials, this tutorial aims to migrate the concepts from imperative perspective to Haskellâ€™s pure functional concepts. It starts with the IO Monad and introduces functional programming concepts as time progresses. Your feedback of this tutorial is extremely important. Please submit any feedbacks through [Issues Page]( https://github.com/UltimatePea/Blog/issues) or email me at zhc159@ucsd.edu.  

## Prerequisite

### Knowledge

This tutorial assumes that the reader knows most language features of the Java programming language.

### Installation

Please install [The Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform). This tutorial gives syntax to compile the program under macOS. 

## Hello World. 

We will begin with the typical `Hello, World` routine that is found on most imperative programming languages.

`File: helloworld.hs`
```haskell
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!!"
```

Save the above file as `helloworld.hs` and run the program using `runhaskell`.

```
$ runhaskell helloworld.hs
Hello, World!!
$
```

## Hello World Explained

### Functions and its types.

When calling a function in Haskell, we write the function's name first, followed by a space and its argument list. In the `hello world` example, `putStrLn` is the name of the function and string `"Hello, World!!"` is its argument. Therefore, `putStrLn` is a function which takes a single string as its argument. 

The type of `putStrLn` is `String -> IO ()`. This means `putStrLn` takes a String as its argument, and returns an empty value `()` wrapped in the `IO` monad. `IO` is a function that constructs a type, namely a type constructor, where the empty value `()` is its argument. `IO ()` constructs the return type of `putStrLn`. We write type annotation by writing the name first, followed by two colons, followed by its type. `putStrLn :: String -> IO ()` means that `putStrLn` is a function that takes a String and returns an empty value wrapped in an `IO` monad. 

### What is a Monad?

You can think of monad as a box. `IO` monad is a box which exposes real world communication such as console interaction to the program itself. In Haskell, every function which does real world communication has to be wrapped in an `IO` monad. Please read on if you don't understand the monad concept. For the time being, you can think of it as a compiler type hint. 

### What is `main`?

`main` function is the only function Haskell runs in the execution. It has type `IO ()`. This makes sense because `main` is something that talks to the realworld. We assigned the value of `putStrLn "Hello, World"` to main. `putStrLn` takes a `String` and returns `IO ()`. Since we called `putStrLn` with a `String` as argument and assigned the result to `main`, the type of `main` is the same as the type of `putStrLn "Hello, World!!"`, `IO ()`.
